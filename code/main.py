        Our system utilizes cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to analyze images of plant leaves and detect potential diseases.

        </p>
        <ul style='font-size: 18px;'>
            <li><b>Deep Learning Models:</b> We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model known for its excellent performance in image recognition tasks. Our CNN is trained to recognize patterns in plant leaves and classify them into healthy or diseased categories.</li>
            <li><b>Training on Large Datasets:</b> The model is trained on a vast dataset of plant images that include different types of diseases. This dataset contains thousands of labeled images, enabling the model to learn and generalize across various plant species and disease types.</li>
            <li><b>Real-Time Prediction:</b> Once the model is trained, users can upload an image of a plant leaf, and the system will process the image in real-time to predict any disease. The prediction is fast and accurate, providing immediate results for timely action.</li>
            <li><b>Technology Stack:</b> Our application is built with TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library, and Streamlit for building interactive web applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style='font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;'>The combination of deep learning and user-friendly interface allows both experts and non-experts to detect plant diseases quickly and efficiently, helping to prevent the spread of diseases and ensuring healthier crops.</p>
